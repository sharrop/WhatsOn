  your audience suggestions\, and their overactive imaginations\, ShakeItUp
  create a brand-new Shakespeare play live on stage\, complete with live mu
 sic\, songs\, and plenty of laughs. At a ShakeItUp show\, you get to help 
 their intrepid improvisors make up an entirely new Shakespeare play on the
  spot! Pick your authentic Shakespearean genre: Epic History\, Romantic Co
 medy\, or Gruesome Tragedy\; choose the location of where we will lay our 
 scene\, our hero’s name\, and even their day-job! Pen your wittiest Shak
 espearean line for our brave actors to pull from their suitably-Shakespear
 ean breeches when they need a helping hand – the twist? They’ll have n
 o idea what the line will be before they say it! \n\nThen sit back and wat
 ch the hilarity unfold as they improvise a totally authentic (and totally 
 bonkers) play that Willy Shakes himself would be proud of! Accompanied by 
 improvised song and music from the talented (and flexible) ShakeItUp Band\
 , expect big laughs\, high drama\, and a healthy dose of rhyming couplets.
